# Intro to React Sprint Challenge

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **introductory React**. During this sprint, you studied **React components and advanced styling**.

In your challenge you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **a Star Wars page** using data from an API.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. All projects will be submitted to Codegrade for automated review.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge.

### Project Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not BloomTech's by mistake!)
- [ ] Install dependencies and use the "start" script to launch the app
- [ ] Implement the project on the main branch, committing changes regularly
- [ ] Push commits: `git push origin main`

## Project Instructions

### Introduction

Inpm start
### Stretch Goals

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on any of the following optional goals:

- [ ] Make the Character component more complex and break it into several subcomponents.
- [ ] Use the endpoint `[GET] https://swapi.dev/api/films/` (mocked in msw) to obtain movie information to render with the characters.
- [ ] Create a helper function in separate module to remove unneeded information from the API data, before putting it in state.
- [ ] Create transitions or animations with styled-components.
- [ ] Use Promise.all to resolve an array of promises.

## Submission format

- [ ] Submit via Codegrade by committing and pushing any new changes to the main branch.
- [ ] Check Codegrade for automated feedback.

## Stretch Interview Questions

1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
1. Describe component state.
1. Describe props.
1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?
